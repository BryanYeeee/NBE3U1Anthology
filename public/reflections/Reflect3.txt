My Rough Notes For The Oral Presentation:
<center>How do we learn to live together?</center>
<div style="white-space: normal; font-family: unset;padding:0% 5%">
<ul>
<li>Learn to live together by contributing to society in a non-conflicting way</li>
    <li>Because if you don’t contribute to your community then you can’t really say you are “living together”</li>
    <li>How do we determine what is non-conflicting?</li>
    <li>Perspectives allow you to understand other people’s wants and needs</li>
    <li>A conjunction of your own wants and your community member’s wants</li>

Text: Cottagers and Indians by Drew Hayden Taylor
    <li>Maureen and Arthur both attempt to live together, so they contribute to their lake</li>
    <li>However, they contribute in a way where their actions conflict</li>
    <li>Maureen:
        <ul>
        <li>Does various actions to remove Arthur’s manoomin (Government actions etc.)</li>
        <li>Doesn’t realize the significance behind the manoomin</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Arthur:
        <ul>
        <li>Plants Manoomin to raise awareness for Indigenous culture, and to repopulate the lake with natural wildlife</li>
        <li>Doesn’t realize that from Maureen’s perspective, it can affect her livelihood</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They both need to look at the other’s perspectives to recognize that their actions conflict</li>
    <li>Significance: Demonstrates the entire theme of the story</li>

Self:
    <li>In grade 10, I was placed into an Indigenous studies course after there were no available slots in my alternatives</li>
    <li>I had to recognize that from the school’s perspective, they didn’t do it to spite me </li>
    <li>Therefore, my “non-conflicting” contribution would just be to take the course without protesting</li>
</ul>
